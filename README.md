# Colurscrest-Paints
I created a landing page that includes the following sections:
Hero section
Product category section
Why Choose Us" section with a call to action
Footer
I also created a separate contact form on a different page. When a user clicks any button (such as the Explore Color" button in the banner section), they are redirected to the contact form page.
After the user submits the form, the submitted data is displayed on the same page (the contact form page) on the front end.
